Key Updates in the Code
FP16 Operations:

Wrapped forward and backward passes in autocast(enabled=self.use_amp) for mixed precision.
Dynamic Loss Scaling:

Used GradScaler to handle scaling for FP16 gradients.
Logits in FP32:

Converted logits to FP32 (outputs.logits.float()) for better numerical stability during WER computation.
Gradient Clipping:

Ensured gradients are unscaled before clipping with self.scaler.unscale_.
Efficient Validation:

Similar FP16 handling in _valid_epoch for validation with logits safely converted to FP32.
This version ensures efficient and stable FP16 training. Let me know if additional modifications are needed!
